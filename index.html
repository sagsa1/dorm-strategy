<h2>Understanding Early-Game Upgrade Priorities</h2>
<p>The first three minutes of a match determine your long-term stability. Investing wisely prevents overwhelming pressure later.</p>

<h3>Best Early-Game Priorities</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Basic Economy Upgrade</strong> – ensures stable mid-game growth</li>
    <li><strong>Level 1 Wall Upgrade</strong> – avoids early collapse</li>
    <li><strong>Starter Turret</strong> – allows consistent damage output</li>
    <li><strong>Second Economy Boost</strong> – scaling advantage</li>
</ol>

<p>
Aim to strike a balance: too much economy makes you vulnerable, but ignoring it slows down your future power spikes.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Best Mid-Game Upgrade Choices</h2>

<p>Mid-game is when monsters become more aggressive. Your build direction becomes fully defined here.</p>

<h3>Recommended Mid-Game Upgrades:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Upgrade primary turret to 3–4 stars</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Improve main wall to mid-tier shield level</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Invest in secondary damage towers (sniper, laser, frost)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Add utility support like energy battery or regen</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>A good rule:  
<strong>Two damage upgrades + one defense upgrade for every economy upgrade.</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>Late-Game Upgrades for Maximum Survival</h2>
<p>Late game focuses on securing your room and preparing for final assaults.</p>

<h3>Top Late-Game Upgrade Goals</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Max out primary turret damage</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Upgrade wall to its final form</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Stack supportive towers (freeze, debuff, AoE)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Fill room slots efficiently</strong></li>
</ul>

<div class="box">
<h3>Best Late-Game Build Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2–3 High DPS turrets (Laser, Sniper)</li>
    <li>1–2 Slow/Freeze support structures</li>
    <li>Fully maxed wall</li>
    <li>Energy battery to avoid stalls</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Top 3 Upgrade Build Paths</h2>

<h3>1. Economy-First Build</h3>
<p>This path offers strong scaling but requires good positioning.</p>

    <li>Focus on long-term damage scaling</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Defense-Heavy Build</h3>
<p>For players who prefer survival-focused gameplay.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Prioritize wall upgrades</li>
    <li>Add supporting turrets slowly</li>
    <li>Great for handling high-pressure monsters</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Aggressive Damage Build</h3>
<p>Best for experienced players.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rush multiple attack towers</li>
    <li>Minimize early wall upgrades</li>
    <li>Aim to eliminate threats early</li>
</ul>
